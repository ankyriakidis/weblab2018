          Headmaster Lombardi, <i>you wouldn’t believe what I saw</i>, Susanna and Addie were screwing around the entire week of the field trip. Ever since we got to camp, they have been constantly playing pranks on the entire seventh grade. It all began
          with throwing Kotex pads with strawberry jam on the boys’ cabin front porch and jumping out of the dark corners of the bathroom to scare people. I am so not surprised I caught them in the act this time!

There wasn’t a line for the boys’ room (what’s new), but that was when something caught my eye."

They will be busted at last! The toilet was clogged to the very top with layers of poop and toilet paper, something best described with the juxtaposition of two words: poop and lasagna. The mirror was covered in so much scum that I wasn’t even able to see my own reflection. The tile floors were plastered with mud and mold. All kinds of dirt or poo had thickened to the walls due to years of neglect, and the smell was nothing like I had ever smelled before or since. The boys’ bathroom was the biggest mess I had ever seen, and I knew Addie and Susanna had catalyzed this destructive process. The only clean-ish thing that I saw was a large white cement bucket."
