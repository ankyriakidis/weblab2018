          Headmaster Lombardi, in all my years being a sponsor and donor for Harding Academy, I have never heard such an absurd tale. I was around during the tampon debacle of oh-five and the flagpole panty crisis of oh-eight, but never have I been so disillusioned
          with this institution. The story I heard come forth from my daughter, Camilla’s, sweet, innocent lips is one that I never could have imagined and one that I <i>definitely</i> would hope not to be true…

Now I knew girls and boys on their own could get into trouble, heck I was kid at one time too you know, but back then we would write swear words on bathroom stall doors and make fart noises when adults spoke to us.
