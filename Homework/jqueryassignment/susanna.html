          Headmaster Lombardi, <i>I swear</i>, Addie and I were just trying to have fun on the trip. Honestly, we were just bored with all the stupid games that seventh graders shouldn’t be playing anymore like Duck, Duck, Goose. We really meant no harm at all. All I
          wanted to do was have my own fun, so yes, I do take responsibility for all the wholesome pranks Addie and I pulled, but what Camilla saw, <i>I swear</i>, was not a prank at all. Besides being known as the seventh grade snitch, she really just has something
          against us since we put a frog on her pillow, so of course this girl is just out to get us! What <i>really</i> happened was…

We ran as fast as we could to the camp outhouse, but when we arrived, the girls’ line was too long for me to wait. I literally felt myself turtle-heading, prairie dogging as they say in the corn belt. Thank God, Addie being the best friend that she is, realized that the boys’ room should be open because the boys didn’t use the actual bathroom because there was this cliff, a walk down the camp trail that the boys would poop off of because “they liked the sound”- whatever that means. Gross. Anyway…"

I flung open the door and honestly, not even a little bit surprised that the boys’ bathroom was such a wreck. I have a brother, we share a bathroom at home, and some of the same habits were identical to the disaster that laid before my eyes."
