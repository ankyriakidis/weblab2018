        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I attended Pope John Paul II, a Catholic high school in the suburbs of Nashville, Tennessee for three years during my high school education. Not until I stepped into the room of Dr. Bogart did I realize how closely similar my high school was to a prison. I knew high school was bad, but I did not know it could fit under the same term of a total institution. Closely similar to Goffman&rsquo;s fifth group of total institutions &ldquo;where establishments were designed as retreats from the world even often serving also as training stations for the religious&rdquo; (5).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Erving
          Goffman also explains mortification through loss of identity and the removal of &ldquo;self&rdquo; which JP2 succeeded by requiring an authoritarian dress code, frequent public humiliations, and continual pledges of arbitrary order. Looking
          back on my high school experience now, through the lens of Goffman&rsquo;s <em>mortification</em>, I believe these stressful experiences make sense in qualifying Pope John Paul II High School as a total institution due to how closely the criteria
          matches. In my time as a high school student, I was mortified by the new identity that was given to me by a Catholic high school.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My experience with a college preparatory Catholic high school was excellent, yet strict and incredibly organized and structured. For example, every day, all the students, Catholic or not, had to take a rigorous Theology class. Every week, all the students were required to attend an all school mass in the morning. Every month, the students were required to attend the reconciliation services. During the season of lent, the school cafeteria participated in the fasting until Easter. The idea of structure relevant to that of Goffman&rsquo;s traits of a total institution, he explains, &ldquo;... social organization is the key fact of total institutions&rdquo; (6). Structure and organization are just two of the characteristics in describing a total institution. Another example of structure is the uniforms we were required to wear all four years. The uniform was excessively strict and even by breaking it just a little bit, like black socks instead of navy blue socks, would result in an after school detention for two hours where you would sit at your desk in your chair without talking, closing your eyes, or putting your head down. Along with structure and organization is arbitrary order where the upperclassmen had a good amount of control over the underclassmen just because they had spent more time in high school. In Zimbardo&rsquo;s Stanford prison experiment where he tested roleplaying powers of guards with authority over inmates is a perfect example of how things could get out of hand with how seniors would treat the new freshman. Name calling, hazing, and other acts of malice would hang over freshmen heads, putting them in their place that freshmen are lesser beings in the high school world. Besides the humiliation upperclassmen would bring to the younger high schoolers, the freshmen and sophomores had more on their plate- lunch lines and lockers. Underclassmen can wait up to forty-five minutes to buy their lunch due to how long the lunch line is. Because of seniority, Freshman go last and leave almost no time to eat or socialize with friends, therefore instead of lunch being a break, it becomes more of a stressful experience for the freshmen and sophomores. On top of that, Freshman lockers are on the third floor and with no access to the elevator, visiting your locker on the third floor to get books between classes is inaccessible because of how much time and energy it takes to travel. There is a five minute period between classes to get from one class to the other, and the second you walk into class, after the bell, results in a dreadful detention. Being stripped of their lunch periods and ability to make the smallest mistake of leaving a homework assignment in their locker and being unable to reach it is a complete act of mortification. As freshman and sophomores, kids are being constantly humiliated in ways they never thought were possible. Piper Kerman had similar feelings of humiliation when she was a new prisoner. She explained that &ldquo;her attire made it glaringly obvious that she was a new inmate&rdquo; (41). Because of a label, people can feel mortified and humiliated. The poor underclassmen at Pope John Paul II High School lived like that for almost two years. </span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The idea of mortification is especially relevant during floor skirt checks. Listening to my particularly dreadful and monotone English speaker drone on about all the symbolic relationships in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play <em>Macbeth</em>, I sat at my desk in the back of the class trying not to fall asleep. Next thing I know, my English teacher&rsquo;s voice is interrupted and washed out by the sound of an excessively loud train whistle and the headmaster&rsquo;s voice on the intercom voluntelling all the females wearing skirts to make their way into the hallway for the daily skirt check. Now my heart is racing as I do my best to unroll all five rolls of my skirt, so the skirt would reach the permissible three inches above my knees before I exited the classroom. Instantly, all the girls chaotically rushed out of the class and began lining up outside of the door. The train whistle still blaring as every girl wearing a skirt formed a straight and silent line outside of their classroom. The almost seven foot, Scottish and incredibly intimidating dean of students, Mr. McLaren, began at the beginning of the hall. Each line of girls would fall to their knees when he would pull out the ruler from his back pocket to carefully measure each skirt. One by one, each girl would either return back to their designated class or run off crying to the Student Life office to receive the consequences. The consequence was a detention and the most dreaded, horrendous, ankle-length, blue plaid skirt. Although the detentions were arguably child abuse, the prairie skirt always seemed to be a much worse punishment. It was unfortunate for some girls because their legs are so long that the skirts just fit them differently, and the measurements would be barely above the three inches qualifying them for the tragic prairie skirt. To see how long they could last without getting caught, other girls would intentionally get their skirts hemmed so their shorts would show under their skirts. But the smart girls, including myself, would have their skirts hemmed perfectly to three inches above their knees and would just roll them until the desired length and roll them back to the sound of the train whistle. What blows my mind the most is that this daily routine could take up to fifteen to twenty minutes out of class time. Also, if our skirts can only be three inches above our knees due to objectification, making girls drop to their knees to get their skirt measured is certainly objectification. This whole ordeal is kind of a lose-lose because I can guarantee that not all girls will wear their skirts at three inches above their knees and no matter what, we will be objectified. Objectification being a huge aspect of mortification and the loss of self. </span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coming from an incredibly liberal arts middle school where art was the center of importance and where individuation was celebrated everyday through what we would wear and how we could express ourselves through speaking, working, and studying, attending a Catholic high school left me like a deer in headlights. In my time as a high school student, I was mortified by the new identity that was given to me by a Catholic high school. Constantly shocked about how students were treated, I found myself frequently mortified and spending more time thinking about what Catholic school was actually accomplishing for me because by the end of high school, I felt like I was not particularly good at anything academically and probably the furthest away from spirituality, and I was so mentally and physically exhausted from how demanding high school is. Sometimes even making the smallest mistake ended up in an unneeded detention just to be used as a deterrent for others and yourself for the next time. Looking back on my high school experience now, through the lens of Goffman&rsquo;s <em>mortification</em>, I believe these stressful experiences make total sense in qualifying Pope John Paul II High School as a total institution due to how closely the criteria matches. In my time as a high school student, I was mortified by the new identity that was given to me by a Catholic high school.</span></p>
