        <p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1">Twin Rivalry: June 6th, 2017</span></p>
        <p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Being a twin, I was blessed to share the same womb with my &lsquo;beloved&rsquo; brother for eight whole months. During those eight months, however, is when the competition began. The fight for scarce resources such as nutrients
          and oxygen was the first. I won that fight. Being twin A, I ransacked everything I could get including my wombmate&rsquo;s nutrients and oxygen. Due to my thieving acts, it forced my mother into labor one month early because my brother stopped
          growing and developing from the lack of food. It may have been evil, but I do not remember it, and I guess you could say it is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; to fight for life. But, the moment I slipped out, I had the advantage of one minute over him.
          A minute later, Seth was born, and everything continued to be a competition. From who would be the first to walk and talk to who could score the highest ACT- every little thing inclined to who would win. The competition all evolved in the same
          environment until we were sophomores in high school. According to Deborah Brandt, our literacy development is sponsored by people, institutions, and circumstances, and we shared all of those. Those three elements make it possible for us to become
          literate and shape the way a person acquires literacy, which was weird because Seth and I shared the same sponsors, in every single way, from religion to school for those fifteen years, but for some reason, everything about our literacies is
          opposite. I am incredibly extroverted and enjoy public speaking, art, history, English, and everything about the humanities. Seth is incredibly introverted and is totally involved with math and science. As stated in Brandt&rsquo;s research,
          sponsorship can open some doors and close others (43).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>I found this relative to the position I have been in with a twin that is male- the competition between male and female. Somehow in those
          fifteen years, gender roles and stereotypes were incredibly influential on our literacy development and outcome. Are we poster children for the power of nature over nurture when it comes to typical gender play impacting our literacy? One might
          ask, is it competition that influenced the gender stereotype?</p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides our sleeping and eating habits, Seth and I were treated the same for the first years of our lives, it started with the blue and pink labels that were established with everything such as blankets, 1st birthday cupcakes, toothbrushes, suitcases, etc. We were read the same books, parented in the same way, and we were born in the same place; Paradise, a small town in Northern California close to Sacramento. I do not remember much about living there besides going to my Nana&rsquo;s house next door to read, color, and play. She read to me and my brother all of the time, but I was always more interested in the stories, while Seth gravitated more towards the Nintendo and computer. The earliest memory I have of reading is with my Nana during the Christmas holiday. I got a huge book that consisted of all the <em>Madeline</em> stories. I vividly remember begging my Nana to let me read it to her all night&nbsp;</span>
          <span
            class="s1">until Santa came. Books were a big gift during any holiday for me, unlike my brother. He hated receiving books, and the books he was given were always re-gifted to me. I always loved receiving them and would read them within the day. We moved
            when I was five years old, due to the mountain lions and forest fires in our backyard and the lack of good schools for my brother and me to attend. Education has always been a crucial part of my parent&rsquo;s values, so off we moved to Nashville,
            Tennessee to continue my literacy journey. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contrary to popular belief, Nashville is a lot different than the stereotypical country and redneck town most people think it is. The touristy parts of town like Broadway with the Boot Barns, Country music karaoke bars, and honky tonks give Nashville the stereotype. The state capital is very liberal and votes blue, like most big cities in the United States. Given the nickname, Music City is much more than music, and celebrates everything about the arts- like the elementary and middle school I attended. The primary focus of the school was the arts. Beginning in kindergarten, the students were required to take visual arts, band, theatre, dance, and chorus, each year until graduation. Even the month of May was deemed as &ldquo;Art Month&rdquo; where an entire week was dedicated to the students to learn all forms of art, ranging from how to play steel drums to hula dancing. At our tiny middle school, we sponsored an art show with artists that traveled across the country to show and sell their art, and the students also had their own art show the same week. These middle school years were the ones I cherished. My literacy and I<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>thrived
          in an environment that celebrated art. Unfortunately for my brother, I won the middle school competition too. Each year, I earned higher grades, joined more sports and clubs, socialized, and my teachers really enjoyed me. Seth was stuck. He
          barely moved on each year, and if you ask him now, he hated middle school. When middle school graduation came, he couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. Now the question is <em>why did Seth not thrive</em>? Why did it appear his literacy development
          was not sparked or positively sponsored, as Brandt would say? Was it the artistic environment that could easily be seen as feminine? The unconscious thought that art is seen as feminine could have influenced negativity on Seth and his motivation
          to succeed while influencing me, positively, which lead to my literacy success and growth. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both of us decided to attend a college preparatory Catholic high school in the suburbs of Nashville. It was excellent, yet strict and incredibly structured. Every year, all the students, Catholic or not, had to take a theology class. Every week, all the students were required to attend an all school mass. Every month, the students were required to attend the reconciliation service. During the season of lent, the school cafeteria participated in the fasting until Easter. I am not very religious, but I do believe in God and his teachings and loved the years I was taught about scripture. Due to the time I spent at a Catholic school, I am familiar with the scriptures and respect those who dedicate their lives to the church. I found safety in the religious environment I was in, and yet again, I thrived. Freshman year was the next competition I won. Freshman year made Seth reach hate in a whole new aspect, I thought he could not have hated school more. He failed out and was not invited back. All of his teachers were so upset with him. After this year and this moment was a tipping point before everything changed. </span></p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moved to Jacksonville, Florida to pursue my career as a swimmer because the Catholic school I attended before was very traditional and unaccommodating to anything that did not fit the structure of the school such as: swimming-related absences. Positively, the experience at boarding school made me grow up a little quicker than most. I learned time management, independence, and much more. I grew emotionally, physically, spiritually, and in literacy as a person. The house of girl boarders I lived in only had three Americans, and I was one of them. There were about thirty girls, and I became so close to all of them. Each month, we celebrated a different culture. For example, the prime minister of Venezuela daughter&rsquo;s were part of residential life. During Venezuelan month, they cooked all of the magical food for us like empanadas. It was truly amazing. Although I was at boarding school for one short year, I will be forever friends with most of those girls. Unfortunately, I did not do very well the year I was at boarding school. I had a very low GPA due to distractions such as being surrounded by my best friends all the time, a lack of sleep, and fun activities. Though my literacy grew arguably on so many levels, you could say I thrived socially, regarding Brandt, but that was about it in terms of hard core markers of academic success as designed by society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>I
          came home from boarding school because my coach left in December of 2015 to coach Singapore&rsquo;s swimming Olympic team, and I did not feel a need for my parents to keep paying college tuition for nothing- especially if I wasn&rsquo;t doing
          well academically. Sophomore year was the first year I lost to my brother. Seth won that competition and would continue to beat me at everything for the rest of high school. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p4"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While I was in Jacksonville, my parents sent Seth to a school where he chose the classes he wanted to take; which were all APs and in a field of math and science he wanted to go in. All of his classes were one-on-one, and he became very close with all of his teachers. With classes so focused on his success and structured in a way that he could learn the best, he thrived. I guess he was so bored during freshman year that he did not do a single thing. He finished off the rest of high school where he earned perfect scores on his ACT and SAT. Another competition he won. He received many scholarships from prestigious universities around the world and finally set on The University of Michigan, the 27th ranked university in the United States, where he will double major in economics and physics. Two things I could never do. When I chose the university I wanted to attend, it really had nothing to do with academics. I just liked the swimming aspect of it the most, and it was in a beautiful, artsy city where I could see myself. I was left with having no idea what I wanted to major in and couldn&rsquo;t find any strengths in anything that could be useful for wealth benefiting jobs like my brother. I would love to go into fine arts or journalism, but what am I supposed to do with that? </span></p>
        <p class="p2"><span class="s1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the roles and impacts of literacy sponsorship were changed, and I began my life as the &lsquo;loser&rsquo;, Seth really began to blossom and prosper. I would like to say I am the reason for Seth&rsquo;s success after living in my shadow for fifteen years, but the same questions are still relevant: <em>Are we poster children for the power of nature over nurture when it comes to typical gender play</em>? <em>Or was it competition that influenced the gender stereotype? </em>Although I may be succeeding and winning in my own way due to many positive sponsors, it will not have the same chance of benefits that my brother now has. It is curious that he is majoring in two very male dominated fields while I am still left unsure about what to do with my life. It is also very unusual that everything that I do well in might be classified as very feminine. Now that we are in college, the next competition has begun. Let us see how these sponsorships impact and motivate us in the years to come. I may have to complete this paper in about four years! </span></p>
