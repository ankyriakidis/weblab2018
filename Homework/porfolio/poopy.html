        <p style="text-align: center;">A Poopy Story: November 2nd, 2017</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Headmaster Lombardi, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe what I saw, Susanna and Addie were screwing around the entire week of the field trip. Ever since we got to camp, they have been constantly playing pranks on the entire seventh
          grade. It all began with throwing Kotex pads with strawberry jam on the boys&rsquo; cabin front porch and jumping out of the dark corners of the bathroom to scare people. I am so not surprised I caught them in the act this time! I was just enjoying
          the bonfire, when the wind changed and the smoke started to blow my way, that I decided to go back to my tent for the night. On the way to my tent, I passed the camp&rsquo;s bathroom. There was a line out the door for the girls&rsquo; room because
          it was a single, with only one toilet and one sink. There wasn&rsquo;t a line for the boys&rsquo; room (what&rsquo;s new), but that was when something caught my eye. I saw them, Susanna and Addie, both with naughty looks painted on their faces
          and mischief twinkling in their eyes. Addie burst into laughter while Susanna entered the boys&rsquo; bathroom. I stood quietly behind a tree and watched Susanna disappear into the restroom, knowing that laughter had to mean the two of them
          were up to something- yet again. I watched expectantly, silently, and then Susanna came out from the bathroom with the walk of a fresh foal, collapsing to her knees in a fit of laughing hysteria, managing this explanation between giggles, &ldquo;Oh,
          Addie! I can&rsquo;t believe I just did that! I was going to explode if I hadn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Then, the two of them collected themselves enough to skip off, laughing their way back to their tent. I decided to take matters into my own hands
          and to finally bust these two delinquents once and for all. I made my way toward the bathroom, trying not to be seen by the long line of girls on the other side of the small outhouse. I opened the door to the boys&rsquo; bathroom and- holy moly,
          the bathroom was wrecked. Oh my God, Addie and Susanna had destroyed the boys bathroom, and I totally saw it happen! They will be busted at last! The toilet was clogged to the very top with layers of poop and toilet paper, something best described
          with the juxtaposition of two words: poop and lasagna. The mirror was covered in so much scum that I wasn&rsquo;t even able to see my own reflection. The tile floors were plastered with mud and mold. All kinds of dirt or poo had thickened to
          the walls due to years of neglect, and the smell was nothing like I had ever smelled before or since. The boys&rsquo; bathroom was the biggest mess I had ever seen, and I knew Addie and Susanna had catalyzed this destructive process. The only
          clean-ish thing that I saw was a large white cement bucket placed right next to the toilet, but wait- WHAT? I inched toward the prodigious can and peeked my head over the side. Oh, Headmaster Lombardi, what I saw that evening was nothing anyone
          would have expected. A single, motionless turd laid at the bottom of that white, cement bucket, and I alone knew the identity of the poo-poo bandit.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Headmaster Lombardi, in all my years being a sponsor and donor for Harding Academy, I have never heard such an absurd tale. I was around during the tampon debacle of oh-five and the flagpole panty crisis of oh-eight, but never
          have I been so disillusioned with this institution. The story I heard come forth from my daughter, Camilla&rsquo;s, sweet, innocent lips is one that I never could have imagined and one that I definitely would hope not to be true. My daughter
          relayed for me a tale from her week long seventh grade unity retreat, telling me of two delinquent girls, by the names of Addie and Susanna, terrorizing the entire class. Let me add, the two of them put a dirty frog on Camilla&rsquo;s pillow
          as a prank! Now I knew girls and boys on their own could get into trouble, heck I was kid at one time too you know, but back then we would write swear words on bathroom stall doors and make fart noises when adults spoke to us. This time though,
          they crossed the line with a Title VII Health and Safety Violation code H.S. 4-A5! Fecal matter in a disposal system besides the the toilet! Jesus Christ, in all my years... I cannot believe the school system has stooped so low, admitting students
          who are not educated on how to use the restroom correctly- A bucket, a FREAKING BUCKET!!! Lord have mercy, justice needs to be served and more than a standard punishment needs to be given to those two girls. I don&rsquo;t know what sentence
          must be handed to these criminals, I waver between expulsion and prison time, but something must be done! They ought to be in therapy, not Harding Academy!</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Headmaster Lombardi, I swear, Addie and I were just trying to have fun on the trip. Honestly, we were just bored with all the stupid games that seventh graders shouldn&rsquo;t be playing anymore like Duck, Duck, Goose. We really
          meant no harm at all. All I wanted to do was have my own fun, so yes, I do take responsibility for all the wholesome pranks Addie and I pulled, but what Camilla saw, I swear, was not a prank at all. Besides being known as the seventh grade snitch,
          she really just has something against us since we put a frog on her pillow, so of course this girl is just out to get us! What really happened was Addie and I were minding our own business in our tent when nature called, no, conscripted me to
          the bathroom. We ran as fast as we could to the camp outhouse, but when we arrived, the girls&rsquo; line was too long for me to wait. I literally felt myself turtle-heading, prairie dogging as they say in the corn belt. Thank God, Addie being
          the best friend that she is, realized that the boys&rsquo; room should be open because the boys didn&rsquo;t use the actual bathroom because there was this cliff, a walk down the camp trail that the boys would poop off of because &ldquo;they
          liked the sound&rdquo;- whatever that means. Gross. Anyways, the idea was perfect because when we rounded the corner, there was not a single boy in line. At that point, both of us were just laughing out of an adrenaline rush because I&rsquo;m
          in the seventh grade and almost about to poop myself!!! I flung open the door and honestly, not even a little bit surprised that the boys&rsquo; bathroom was such a wreck. I have a brother, we share a bathroom at home, and some of the same habits
          were identical to the disaster that laid before my eyes. I frantically looked around, the toilet was not an option. It was overflowing. It looked like no one had ever flushed that thing before, filled to the top with toilet paper and crap. My
          eyes darted from the floor to the sink, neither were an option- I&rsquo;m not that primitive. I glanced back over to the toilet, and I realized I missed something, a beautifully white, clean bucket with a godly aura that beckoned me over to
          it. Score. Headmaster Lombardi, I swear, it wasn&rsquo;t meant as a prank. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t even understand why this is such a big deal. In the moment, I felt like it was the best option. I had nowhere else to go&hellip; Based on a true
          life event.</p>
