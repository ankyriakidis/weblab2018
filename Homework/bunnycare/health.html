        <strong>Pellets and Hay:</strong> For rabbits under one year old free feed them, as much as they want, a fresh, plain, high fiber (18-20%), mid-range protein (14% – 16%) pellet. Adult rabbits should get 1/4 cup of low protein (10% or lower), high
        fiber pellets per day. Do not feed your rabbit any of the many commercial pellet mixes that contain seeds, dried fruit or colored cereals. These commercial treat foods are geared to look pleasing to us humans, but they are definitely not in the
        best health interests of your pet rabbit. Rabbits are not seed, fruit, or cereal eaters by nature and these types of junk foods are high in sugars and carbohydrates, which can lead to an overgrowth of bad bacteria.
        <p>
          <strong>Hay is the most important factor in your rabbit’s diet.</strong> It is his prime source of fiber, which is instrumental in keeping the gut in good working order. Also, hay is a great source of chewing material which is necessary to keeping
          their teeth healthy. A rabbit’s teeth grow continuously throughout their life, and it is essential that we provide them with safe chewing materials such as hay and wooden chew toys to help keep them filed down. A rabbit with tooth problems is
          a rabbit on his way to having GI problems as well.

        <p>
          <strong>Vegetables and Fruit:</strong> It is important to feed your rabbit a daily variety of fresh vegetables to help balance out the nutritional needs in their diet. Feed two to four cups of fresh vegetables a day. All vegetables should be
          fresh, washed and organic whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may occasionally feed your rabbit a bit of fruit. It is extremely important that you limit their intake to no more than one or two tablespoons of high fiber fruits (pears, apples, tomatoes, etc.) no more than one or two times a week. Never give fruit
          to dieting bunnies. Too much sugar can make your bunny fat!
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeding your rabbit a limited amount of high fiber pellets, abundant fresh grass, hays and a daily assortment of fresh vegetables is a key factor in keeping your rabbit healthy. Remember, exercise is just as important as diet in keeping the rabbit functioning
          and healthy. A rabbit should get a minimum of 3 to 5 hours out of cage exercise every day. Also, keep in mind that time balance is just as important to your rabbit’s diet as is nutritional balance. It is important to divide the pellets and vegetables
          between the morning and evening meals, while always having hay and fresh water available at all times.

        <strong>Health & Nutrition</strong><br>Most people think that rabbit pellets were especially formulated for their pet rabbit, but this is not the case. Pellets were originally formulated as a convenient and economical way to promote quick growth
        and weight gain in commercial rabbits raised for food and fur. Our rabbits are our friends and companions and we want them to live long, healthy lives. This is why it is crucial that we learn about and understand their dietary needs.
